# Grading Notes

General
- Everything pulled together so nicely! The gameplay was easy and fun, and the overall aesthetics were awesome.
- Some UX things I noticed (not taking points off, just providing things to think about):
    - When I click "Ready?" I didn't realize I had to scroll down to the next button. The spinny image kinda looks like a loading graphic, so my first instict was to wait! I realize you have instructions, but I honestly glossed over them.
    - The instructions maybe would have stuck better if in a list instead of the paragraph.
    - I would have liked to see my answers distinguished from the rest of the story text - maybe with a fun wavy color underline - so that I can quickly see what options I ended up with.

CSS
- Nice job keepin' it clean! There were only some minor spacing issues.
- It was fairly easy to follow along with your class names and IDs, but one suggestion I have for further improving readability and understanding is to group your blocks of rules and use comments to describe what they're applying to. For example, grouping together all the form styles, or the landing page styles and giving them comment headers.

JS
- See notes in the files themselves!
- Great job at keeping things neat and clean. It was super easy to glance through your files to get an overview of what each method was doing, then dig in as needed.
