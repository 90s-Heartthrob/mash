## Project Pitch

### Problem Statement
We're looking to tap into the deep rooted nostalgia of the 90s kids who are grown up today and combine it with their love of technology.

### Solution
90s Heartthrob will use technology to captivate their childhood memories through the game of MASH.

### Benefits
- Easy to use and access without need of primitive materials
- Interact with friends and reminisce childhood memories
- Fun and interactive time killer that engages friends
