            <p>Who doesn’t remember this timeless classic game played by elementary, junior high, and high school aged kids? MASH! MASH is an acronym that stands for Mansion, Apartment Shack House. To find out which one of those dwellings you’re going to live in someday, and other things like what kind of car you’ll drive and who you’ll marry, you have to play MASH!</p>
            <br>

            <p>Mash could be played with pen and paper but have gone ahead and created this nifty site for you to do your MASHing. For this version of the game there are four categories. Enter three variations of these categories into the form on the next page. At this point in time you’ll need to hit the Ready button to start the spiral. When you feel enough time has passed hit the “Find out your future” button to see the results.
